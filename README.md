Personal Website
=================

My little place on the web has found a new home.

I have switched to Static Site Generator - Jekyll after using WordPress for more than 3 years.
This repository contains all the HTML, CSS, Markdown, SCSS required to power Jekyll which serves them on the web.

## Good things about Jekyll + Git

- Version Control. Everytime, Everywhere. 
- No FTP, SFTP. Just fire up your terminal & Git away.
- No backend, Database or other server side issues to worry about.
- No limits on space & bandwidth
- No server management
- No CMS to manage, learn or upgrade.
- Security issues become less of a headache.

## Awesome things about this setup


- I can now publish straight from my favourite text editor.
- Markdown & Liquid support to help me with Markup.
- CSS Pre-Processor workflow becomes easier.
- Fully functioning Blog with pretty permalinks.
- Save $10/m on my hosting bills

I am a front-end designer & switching to this new setup/workflow for my site allows me to lead from the front. 
I just do the markup, add a bit of styling and push it to Git. Voila. It couldn't get any simpler. 

I encourage you to look around the code and explore the repo.

No Copyright or other form of legalese to bother you here. 
*Have a nice day!*
