Personal Website
=================

My little place on the web has found a new home.

Trying up Jekyll with Git for the first time as it is the new cool thing :D

## Good things about Jekyll + Git

- Version Control. Everytime, Everywhere. 
- No FTP, SFTP. Just fire up your terminal & Git away.
- No backend, Database or other server side issues to worry about.
- No limits on space & bandwidth
- No server management
- No CMS to manage, learn or upgrade.
- Security issues become less of a headache.

## Awesome things about this setup

- I can now publish straight from my favourite text editor (Sublime Text).
- Markdown & Liquid support to help me with Markup.
- CSS Pre-Processor workflow becomes easier.
- Fully functioning Blog with pretty permalinks.
- Save $15/m on my hosting bills

I am a Full-Stack developer & switching to this new setup/workflow for my site allows me to lead from the front. 
I just do the markup, add a bit of styling and push it to Git. Voila. It couldn't get any simpler. 

I encourage you to look around the code and explore the repo. And if you liked it, You can copy the repo also! :)

*Have a nice day!*
