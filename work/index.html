<p>I create <s>mobile</s> future friendly websites. What does that mean you ask?</p>

<p>Your website will be accessible on every device you'd want it to, starting from a 3 year old computer to your neighbour's shiny Apple MacBook Pro.<br />I've got it all covered.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary's iPad will work just fine too. Google Glass, well sure, if you've got the money, I'll even beam it across the sky to the moon. We're still friends right?</p>
