<p>I create <s>mobile</s> future friendly websites. What does that mean you ask?</p>

<p>Your website will be accessible on every device you'd want it to, starting from a 3 year old computer to your neighbour's shiny Apple MacBook Pro.<br />I've got it all covered.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary's iPad will work just fine too. Google Glass, well sure, if you've got the money, I'll even beam it across the sky to the moon. We're still friends right?</p>

	<h2 class="work-title">Online Book Buying Company | United States (2013)</h2>

	<p>I implemented this site, creating a custom shopping cart system to allow users to sell their books and a custom back end administration system that provides my client with the ability to administer many of the options on the site.  This site links to pricing data from Amazon.com and uses the client's variable selection so build a buyback price for book ISBN numbers entered by users.</p>
