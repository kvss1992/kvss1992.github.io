	<p>To keep things simple - I create websites. If web apps are your thing then sure - I am pretty good at that too! <br /><em>What I really do is Built experiences for your customers so they can keep coming again and again!</em></p>

	<p>If you are curious, I suggest taking a moment out to browse through some of my <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/work">past work.</a></p>

	<p>Some things that consume my time for a good measure : </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Good Architectural design application </li>
		<li>Writing code that doesn't look like gospel</li>
		<li>Improving web apps</li>
		<li>I am online if ( !sleeping )</li>
		<li>eating if ( !online &amp;&amp; !sleeping )</li>
		<li>working out if ( !eating &amp;&amp; !online &amp;&amp; !sleeping )<strong></strong></li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>&nbsp;I<br>
	</strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li><em>make</em> web a better place</li>
	<li><em><s>do</em> lots of WordPress stuff</li>
	<li><em>develop</em> platform agnostic Web apps</li>
	<li><em>believe</em> code is Poetry</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I strongly encourage you to work with me. I am one of those rare bread of coder unicorns who code their own ideas. <br />It's best to <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact">email me</a>. I am usually prompt in replying back. </p>

	<p class="laziness">*This is a <em>living document</em>. The above stuff may change when author feels compelled due to internal or external forces. He must ward off laziness to make modifications required with time or due to change of interests. For you, it means – keep revisiting. One day, you’ll find what you’re looking for :) </p>
