The past year has been eventful. I accomplished some goals that I had set for myself while some remain unfulfilled. Like every year, some promises were kept others forgotten. I am happy to note that on a whole 2011 shaped rather nice. Professionally, I added some new skills to my armor. I learned. I am wiser than I was last year and I am more content with myself that I ever was.

<h3>The Prophecy</h3>
I will try and resist the rge to declare the list of things I will accomplish in the coming year. I think its unhealthy to confine yourself within a preplanned agenda. Nevertheless, I will list somethings which are my priority at the moment. Hopefully, as the year progresses, I will be able to tick them off gradually or maybe discover some more. 

<ul>
	<li>Devote more time to iOS Development</li>
	<li>Spend more days/week in at the Club</li>
	<li>Get better at jQuery</li>
	<li>Break for a vacation around some Beach</li>
	<li>Learn at-least 5 new web related skills</li>
	<li>Eat Healthy</li>
	<li>Procrastinate less</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goals or Resolutions</h3>
I am not sure if the above items are part of my yearly goals or New Year resolutions. I forbid myself to classify them into any particular category. For now, I just look forward to working my way through the list.
