Its been over 20 days since my <a title="Hope &amp; Hearing" href="{{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/tympanoplasty-mastoidectomy/">ear surgery</a> and I am happy to say that I am recovering well.

Its not as quick as I had anticipated however my doctor thinks its satisfactory. Healing is a gradual process or so, I have learned.
<h3>The Good stuff</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I have resumed my normal routine and have joined college again.</li>
	<li>I am able to work without any discomfort or issues.</li>
	<li>Pain &amp; swelling post surgery have all subsided and my ear looks just fine</li>
	<li>I should be able to hear again from operated ear in about 45 days time</li>
	<li>The cotton swabs and bandages are all off.</li>
	<li>The sutures have healed and there's no scar! yay!</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bad stuff</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Ear discharge still persists and needs cleaning up every few hours or so</li>
	<li>Its a little annoying to keep cleaning up your ear but I guess that's part of the recovery process too.</li>
	<li>Although not being able to hear from one side is not much of an issue, it needs a little getting used to in college where you need to listen to friends,folks and sometimes even the professors.</li>
</ul>
In all I am happy with my progress. I did not experience any major issues and it all fell in place.

Each day was an improvement and made me feel better. Although, I do have to admit the first week was a little uncomfortable due to the discomfort and mild pain from time to time.

<em>I am hoping to be able to hear again in the next few weeks. All the best to me!</em>
