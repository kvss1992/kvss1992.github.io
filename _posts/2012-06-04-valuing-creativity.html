<blockquote><em>Picasso is sitting in the park, sketching. A woman walks by, recognizes him, runs up to him and pleads with him to draw her portrait. He's in a good mood, so he agrees and starts sketching. A few minutes later, he hands her the portrait. The lady is ecstatic, she gushes about how wonderfully it captures the very essence of her character, what beautiful, beautiful work it is, and asks how much she owes him. "$5,000, madam," says Picasso. The lady is taken aback, outraged, and asks how that's even possible given it only took him 5 minutes. Picasso looks up and, without missing a beat, says: "No, madam, it took me my whole life."</em></blockquote>

The above anecdote captures the true essence of creative work. You can not value creativity by the time the craftsman takes to complete it, rather its the amount of time and effort that went into making him good enough for that purpose.

In the same light, prospective buyers have often quizzed me on my professional fee, considering that it should not take me more than ' N hours '  as per their estimate. I have at times refused prospective customers who value my work based on their scale of time.

Involved in creative work in the Web industry, I can whole heartedly endorse the thought that your work's value should rest on your determined factors and not someones idea of time.

<em>Is creativity an outcome of an intelligent mind which deserves much more?</em>
