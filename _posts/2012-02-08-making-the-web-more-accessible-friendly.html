I have come to realize that :

  <ol>
    <li>Websites are funny.</li>
    <li>Design is functional</li>
</ol>

<em>Everything else is fluff</em>.

There are visually attractive designs and then there are functional designs. The difference between the two can be perceptually deceptive. It takes a little bit of time to distinguish a good design from an efficient one. In my search for an efficient design paradigms I have come across various fancy terms like - <strong>Responsive</strong>, <strong>Adaptive</strong>, <strong>Progressive</strong> , <strong>Fluid</strong> etc

A good design offers beautiful <strong>user experience (UX)</strong>. Its easy to use and flows <em>intuitively</em>. The way it looks is old school. The way it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">feels</span> is more important for anyone to be able to connect with the experience. When you are able to offer an immersive experience for your visitor - that becomes a good design.

<h3>Guidelines for a Good Design</h3>
<ul>
	<li><em>Think</em> from the perspective of the user</li>
	<li>YOU are <em>not</em> the user</li>
	<li>Design using a <em>Mobile First</em> Approach</li>
	<li>Make it universal</li>
	<li><em>Don't assume</em> things on your users behalf</li>
	<li>Test on different platforms</li>
	<li>Rinse. Repeat</li>
</ul>
I am on my way to acquire a new skill for the year 2012. You can call it Responsive, Adaptive, Fluid whatever. I'll just call it <em>functional</em>.

<em>Are you designing for the growing number of platforms and devices? What's your approach? Feel free to share if you have any comments.Â </em>
