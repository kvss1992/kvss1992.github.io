  description: Karanvir Sawhney is a Full Stack Web Developer from Montreal, Canada. I primarily use PHP, but picking up a new framework or language isn't a problem. I have extensive programming experience and I'm comfortable developing on the frontend or backend as well as setting up or managing infrastructure.

<p>My name is Karanvir Sawhney and I am a full stack developer with huge passion for MVC front-end frameworks and web design. I love building beautifully structured JavaScript heavy apps with Rails backend. </p>

<p>I'm just a developer who ships. The rest is luck and speculation.</p>

<p>I have helped many business owners like you create a compelling web presence.</p>
